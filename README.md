# Tracker

This project is used to track devices' inventory. The Mobile Application Design & Development program is able to keep track of who currently has which devices in their possession so students are able to sign out devices overnight for development purpose.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
